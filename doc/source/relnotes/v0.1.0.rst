Features in 0.1.0 (January 18, 2023)
====================================

Initial release with the following functionality:

- :py:meth:`fuzzy join <pandance.fuzzy_join>`:
  Inner join matching numerical columns approximately.
  Supports numerical and built-in Python ``decimal.Decimal`` column types.
- :py:meth:`theta join <pandance.theta_join>`:
  Inner join matching columns according to a user-specified matching function.

Known issues
------------

* The order of columns in the fuzzy join result reflect the length of the input
  DataFrames, not the left/right order of the arguments,
  with columns from the longer DataFrame appearing on the right.
  Fixed in :ref:`v0.2.0 <relnotes020>`.
